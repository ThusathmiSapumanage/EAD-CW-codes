This is the final version of my EAD CW :)

I used jasper reports for report creation and also implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions, to a MYSQL database with the help of XAMPP and PhpMyAdmin. Java was used as the programming language and JFrames were used for GUI creation.

This project was made in 3 to 4 days.
